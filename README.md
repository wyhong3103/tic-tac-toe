# Tic Tac Toe Webapp

A pretty fun project in general, gained a little insights into minimax algorithm from Wikipedia, it was pretty fun. But honestly, I don't have a clue how to implement minimax on this game. So, I came across this [article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/minimax-algorithm-explanation-using-tic-tac-toe-game-22668694aa13#:~:text=This%20algorithm%20is%20widely%20used,benefit%20and%20maximize%20self%2Dbenefit) and took inspiration from it, and made my own dfs + minimax algorithm (kind of). And this is actually my very first project where I learned to organize my code (not so organized, but I am learning!) with modular & factory functions. That's all I guess, lol. Feel free to review my code and tell me how can I improve on it!
